## Content
This is repository is intended as a super fast intorduction to code reproducibility and sharing. The main aim is to get you started as quickly as possible. By nature the content is therefore not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of the topic. If you would like to delve-in deeper, I recommend you explore the web and scientific literature on the topic.

## What is code reproducibility? Why share your code?
Reproducibility in science is a complex topic and goes to the the core of scientific philosophy. I think [Goodman et al. 2016]() recent(ish) discussion on the subject in *Science Translational Medicine* is an excellent starter, but you will find plenty of other good reading out there.

Simply put, the key idea behing code reproductibility is to ensure that your process of getting from your raw data to your results is as transparent as possible. Ideally, any other interested researcher should be able to conduct your statistical analysis and re-create your figures, tables and model outputs simply by downloading your data and running your code. If you managed to do so, you will not only allow other researchers to fully judge the quality of your findings, but you also give the scientific community a chance to develop further on the code that you have produced.

There are many more reasons to share your code and make sure it is as well documented as possible:
- You're working with colleague's and collaborators on a shared project.
- You're producing work for a journal that requires open access to all data and code (most journals do these days).
- You're work is funded by a funding body that requires your research outputs to be fully open.
- You're producing work for an assignment that needs to be marked (by your advisor).
- You might want to look back at what you have done in ten years time.
